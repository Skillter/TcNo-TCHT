# Lets user pick an install path for software
# Creates folder, and adds to PATH if not already.
# ----------------------------------------

#TODO: Add a Current Folder option, that just prints CD. Installs there. Return both the install folder as well as the C:\TCHT or whichever folder was picked for reference in the program
#TODO: Also save the path to the install folder in a text file so that the future uninstall script can refer to it...

.Synopsis
Creates folders to later install a program to a specified path and adds the installation path to the user or system PATH environment variable.

.Description
The Install-ProgramPath function allows users to choose between installing a program for their user only or for all users, and creates a directory for the program at the specified location. The function then checks if the installation path is already present in the user or system PATH environment variable, and adds it to the appropriate PATH variable if necessary. The function returns the path to the directory where the program will be installed.

.Parameter ProgramName
Specifies the name of the program to be installed.

.Example
Install-ProgramPath -ProgramName "Whisper"
Prompts the user to choose between installing the Whisper program for their user only or for all users, creates a directory for Whisper at the specified location, and adds the installation path to the appropriate PATH environment variable.
This does not actually install anything, just lets you use the returned path/Whisper, as well as add Whisper to returned path/programs where it can be used from PATH.
