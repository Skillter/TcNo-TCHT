# ----------------------------------------
# This script:
# 1. Installs Chocolatey (for installing Python and FFMPEG) - https://chocolatey.org/install
# 2. Check if Conda or Python is installed. If neither: install Python using Choco (if Python not already detected)
# 3. Installs FFMPEG using Choco (if FFMPEG not already detected)
# 4. Install CUDA using Choco (if CUDA not already detected)
# 5. Install Pytorch if not already installed, or update. Installs either GPU version if CUDA found, or CPU-only version
# 6. Verify that Whisper is installed. Reinstall using another method if not.
